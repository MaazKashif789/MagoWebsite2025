        <h1>Globalization</h1>
        <p>Our duty is to bring the benefits of globalization to our customers regardless of their location; this demands a global reach in supply, yet a local perspective in customer service. From the fields of mid-America to the industrial ports of Japan, from the markets of Brazil to REACH-regulated Europe, and everywhere in between, mego takes a local approach while giving customers global access.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For decades Mago has differentiated itself from chemical traders and importing agents with our extensive knowledge and service, enabled by our dedication to cultivating relationships with our manufacturing partners. In order to provide our customers with comprehensive supply chain solutions, we believe it is imperative to provide - beyond the items of commerce themselves - a complete understanding of the global chemical manufacturing landscape behind our products; the major global manufacturers for a given chemical, regulatory policies and geopolitical affairs related to countries of origin, raw material positions and production cycles, and anything else that might affect a producer's reliability and long-term commercial viability as a producer.</p>
